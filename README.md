UDP_FILE_TRANSFER_TOOL
Overview
The UDP File Transfer Tool is a graphical desktop application built with Python, Tkinter, and the socket library to facilitate file sharing between devices over a network using the UDP protocol. The application allows:
â€¢	Users to send files to a specified IP and port.
â€¢	Receivers to listen for incoming file data and save it locally.
â€¢	Real-time notifications and logs of the transfer process.
This project is ideal for understanding how UDP works in practice, particularly the stateless, connectionless nature of this protocol.


Key Features
â€¢	Graphical User Interface (GUI): Built with Tkinter for user-friendliness.
â€¢	UDP Sockets: Uses socket.AF_INET and socket.SOCK_DGRAM for fast, lightweight communication.
â€¢	File Chunking: Files are split into large chunks (60,000 bytes) and reassembled after reception.
â€¢	Concurrent File Reception: Uses Python threads to receive files without freezing the GUI.
â€¢	Real-Time Logs: Displays live updates in a scrollable log window.
â€¢	Custom Save Directory: Receiver can choose where to store incoming files.
â€¢	Multiplatform Support: Works on Windows, Linux, and macOS.
 Configuration Constants
â€¢	CHUNK_SIZE = 60000: Controls size of each data packet.
â€¢	TIME_BETWEEN_CHUNKS = 0.05: Delay between sending packets.
â€¢	RECEIVE_TIMEOUT = 60: Timeout for waiting on incoming packets.
â€¢	DEFAULT_RECEIVED_DIR = "received_files": Default folder for storing received files.
 How It Works
 File Sending Process
1.	User selects a file and inputs receiverâ€™s IP and port.
2.	The file is read in binary mode and broken into chunks.
3.	Each chunk is prepended with a header: ID:<packet_number>:.
4.	An initial message (FILENAME:<filename>) informs the receiver of the file name.
5.	Once all packets are sent, a special __END__ packet signifies completion.
File Receiving Process
1.	The receiver clicks Start Listening on a chosen port.
2.	On receiving FILENAME:<name>, the app starts storing incoming packets in a dictionary indexed by their packet ID.
3.	When __END__ is received, all chunks are reassembled and saved to the selected directory.
 Communication Format
â€¢	Header: ID:<packet_id>: followed by binary data.
â€¢	Control Messages:
o	FILENAME:<filename> â€“ file name header.
o	__END__ â€“ transmission complete.
GUI Structure
Interface Overview
The interface consists of three main sections:
1. Sender Frame
â€¢	Fields:
o	File path (with browse option)
o	Receiver IP address
o	Port number
â€¢	Button: ðŸ“¤ Send File
2. Receiver Frame
â€¢	Field: Listening port
â€¢	Buttons:
o	ðŸŸ¢ Start Listening (saves to default directory)
o	ðŸ“¥ Receive File Now (allows custom directory selection)
3. Log Area
â€¢	Scrollable text window that shows:
o	IP resolution
o	Packet transfer status
o	Errors, warnings, and success notifications
Style & Design
â€¢	Background colors: Blue, Green, Grey
â€¢	Fonts: Times New Roman UI, Consolas
â€¢	Iconic buttons for modern UI experience

 Page 5: Setup Instructions
 Requirements
â€¢	Python 
â€¢	Tkinter (comes pre-installed with Python)
â€¢	No external libraries required
 Installation
1.	Clone or download the repository:
git clone https://github.com/ben-b2828/udp-file-transfer-tool.git
a. Navigate to the project folder
b. Run the application

 Notes
â€¢	Make sure both sender and receiver are connected to the same network.
â€¢	Firewalls and antivirus software may block UDP communication â€” allow access when prompted.

Limitations, Enhancements & Credits
 Limitations
â€¢	No built-in encryption or compression.
â€¢	Packets can be lost as UDP is not reliable â€” no retransmission of lost chunks.
â€¢	No support for very large files (> hundreds of MBs) on unstable networks.
 Potential Improvements
â€¢	Add file integrity checks (e.g., using checksums).
â€¢	Implement packet acknowledgments and retransmission for reliability.
â€¢	Add multi-file transfer and drag-and-drop support.
â€¢	Add progress bars and file size indicators.
